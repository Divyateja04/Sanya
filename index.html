          <span>Hey Sanya, So you already know that you are one of my closest friends in life. I never was close to anyone in life until now. To be honest, typing a message to you is really hard, I already told you most of the stuff. I can tell you one thing though, I had many experiences during this lockdown some good and the other bitter but you stood by me for every one of them and I hope I was able to do the same for you.</span>

      <section class="section2">
        <div>
          <span>And you are one of those with whom I shared many moments of my life!!! Even the most weird and absurd ones!! I still remember the times when you consoled me when I was depressed, crying or doing random nonsense.</span>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="section3">
        <div>
          <span>And that means I would have been sulking around throughout lockdown without you and this is true. You can be like - I have other friends but then I never spoke to anyone as much as I spoke to you. Youâ€™re almost like a celebrity in my eyes. And you know what, you deserve a prize for putting up with me, I know you don't accept it but then it's hard to put up with me.</span>
